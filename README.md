# the funnies / private

## Description

Quick write up on this *semi* private method i've had for like a year.

## Overview

basically the method is just blocking a specific function in teleportservice and then spamming it i have a cheat engine script that does half of the work for me, 
but my friend told me it’s possible to do it with ce + an executor, which is apparently more reliable than the one i’m using. anyway, which shouldn’t work anymore, but roblox staff is a joke. 
i’ve used this to dupe in type soul, deepwoken, and rogue lineage, and to just crash servers for fun
